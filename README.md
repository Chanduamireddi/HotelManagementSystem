# Hotel Management System

# Project Overview:
- The Hotel Reservation System is a web-based application designed to transform the way hotels manage bookings and reservations. Traditionally, hotels have relied on manual or semi-digital methods for handling bookings, which can often result in inefficiencies, double bookings, and lack of a centralized reservation process.
- The proposed system addresses these issues by providing a fully automated, online platform that allows users to effortlessly browse available rooms, check rates, and make reservations in real time. The application aims to enhance the customer experience by offering a streamlined interface where users can manage their bookings, view confirmation details, and make any necessary modifications, such as cancellation or rescheduling.
- On the hotel’s end, the system will enable staff to easily monitor room availability, track guest check-ins and check-outs, manage customer preferences, and provide personalized services. The real-time integration of the system with the hotel’s back end will prevent common problems such as overbooking and manual errors in booking allocations.
